# Habit Tracker
### (Brief 3 *If this then that - Habit tracker using vanilla JS*)

The brief was our first group project where we were building a habit tracker. We in group 4 was Ebba Jonsson, Sanna Vogel, Cecilia Hallerby and Omid Haqbin. The most imporant was to organize the project and break down tasks, practice pair programming and work with git.
We created a study aid that would help you keep track of your studies and motivate you to finish your studies/book.
